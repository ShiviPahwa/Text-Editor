# Text-Editor
This text editor will let the user enter, change, store, and print text. It will provide an "empty" display screen (or "scrollable page") with a fixed-line length. Those lines could be filled with text, line by line. User will be able to move to a new page, scroll forward or backward, make global changes in the document, save the document, and perform other actions. After saving a document, user will be able to then display it. Before displaying it, user will be able to format it. It will also be used to enter program language source statements or to create documents such as technical manuals. It will also work as HTML validator.
